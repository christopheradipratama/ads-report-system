# ads-report-system
Task 1 - Internship at ADS Digital Partner

<p align="justify">The report system is created with the purpose of facilitating the public in expressing dissatisfaction, ideas, and complaints regarding various aspects of services and situations within a particular region. The public can access this complaint system platform freely and openly, catering to all segments of society. Those who wish to report their grievances can fill out the form provided on the homepage. Filling out this form also does not require individuals to register in advance, thus making it easier for the public to report complaints. Reports submitted by the public cannot be arbitrary because individuals are required to input their name and identification number, as well as other data such as place of birth, date of birth, and address, which will later be verified by the operator. Moreover, the reports must also include supporting evidence so that operators can easily process them.</p>

<p align="justify">For operators or personnel who will handle the processing, they must log into the platform through their registered accounts. Operators play a crucial role as they can view public reports, process them, check the status of reports, and review the report history. By utilizing this Report System, residents can simply submit their complaints through the official website that has been provided. This process provides greater ease of access and flexibility for the public to convey their feedback, without the need to go directly to government offices.</p>
